Step 7: Data Pipeline Design


The development of Pipeline Design or Extracting, Transforming and Loading Data into a Curated Zone through an ETL Pipeline structuring out of the data sets being considered within questions. For example, if we consider the status of the details on the business offices licensing per year as we can consider the “Identification Count” or the “Total Amounts of Accepted Licenses”, “Total Licences”, “Years”, to later see the question of “How much is the rate of Accepted Licenses in Cities among the datasets of City of Vancouver” (City of Vancouver, 2024).
