Step 1: Data Analytical Question Formulation 
Step 1.1. Organization of Data Information to Solve for Questions in City of Vancouver (COV) for the Business, Economic and Financial environment within the information for open source and use online.

Which is the city with the most business licences from 1997 to 2024 according to the City of Vancouver in registrations?(Walter Paz).

Step 6: Data Storage
 
Figure R - Bucket Creation in S3 (Walter Paz)
 
Figure S - City of Vancouver Business Office for the Landing, Curated and Raw Zones for Data (Walter Paz).

Step 7: Data Pipeline Design
The development of Pipeline Design or Extracting, Transforming and Loading Data into a Curated Zone through an ETL Pipeline structuring out of the data sets being considered within questions. For example, if we consider the status of the details on the business offices licensing per year as we can consider the “Identification Count” or the “Total Amounts of Accepted Licenses”, “Total Licences”, “Years”, to later see the question of “How much is the rate of Accepted Licenses in Cities among the datasets of City of Vancouver” (City of Vancouver, 2024).

Step 8: Data Cleaning
 
Figure U - Schema is viewed for Data Cleaning (Walter Paz).
 
Figure V - Data Cleaning Process can either be held in Excel, Google Sheets or even in Data Brew regarding needs or changes.
 
Figure W - Operational's Team mistakes in leaving too many nulls can be an issue in certain cases for accounting for questions. (Walter Paz)

Step 10: Data Pipeline Implementation
 
Figure X - Data Pipeline Generation
 
Figure Y - Compartment management for multi-dataset analysis.
 
Figure Z - ETL Process of Exporting to Curated Zone

Step 11: Data Analysis
 
Figure AA - SQL and Table creation for Analysis for the optimal analysis of individual data as a conglomerate.
 
Figure BB - SQL is used to see the rates not only for values but to verify information too. Sometimes smaller data will be affected according to filters and schemas.
 
Figure CC - Checking rates is essential for the logical responding out of questions into reports.
 
 
Figure DD - Mixed Rates showcase from Athenas
 
Figure EE - Average Rates due to Issues in Mixing of Datasets from 1997-2024 (Registrations held up to 2023 and 2024 according to CSV’s) for complete outlook upon cities of registered
 
Step 12: Data Visualization

 
Figure FF - First Checking of Data Visualization but is missing to Normalize Data from 1997-2024 for City of Vancouver (Walter Paz).
 
Figure GG - Licensed Business Rates according to City of Vancouver (COV) from 1997 – 2024.
 
Figure HH - Normalization must be held for optimal number visualization overall.

Step 13: Data Publishing
 
Figure KK - Publishing from PDF to a common domain inside of the City of Vancouver (COV) (Walter Paz).
 
Figure LL - Transformation formatting can have a few issues from PDF as an Excel is a wide Landscape Sheet (Walter Paz).
 
Figure MM - Instances on AWS EC created for processing and storage.
 
Figure NN - Sharing of Window's General Server in AWS 2024.
 
Figure OO - File Sharing

DAP Estimated Cost (Teamwork)
Please share the estimated cost of the dataset preparation phase.: You need to use the AWS pricing calculator to estimate the cost of using AWS services for this platform.
